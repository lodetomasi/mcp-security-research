This directory contains the results of running the MCP security vulnerability demonstration.

## Files

### attack-demo-output.txt

Complete console output from running the attack chain demonstration.

**Contents**:
- Step-by-step execution log
- Server responses
- Command outputs
- Verification results

### attack-report.json

Structured JSON report of the attack demonstration.

**Includes**:
- Attack flow diagram
- Vulnerabilities exploited
- Security measures bypassed
- Impact assessment
- CVSS scoring
- Mitigation recommendations

## Results Summary

**Attack Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**

**Execution Timeline**:
1. Server 1 fetched malicious HTML (no validation)
2. Server 2 would extract commands from HTML comments
3. Server 3 executed commands (whitelist passed)
4. Files created in sandbox
5. Attack verified

**Files Created**:
- `pwned.txt` (38 bytes) - Contains "Attack successful - Server 1 bypassed"

**Commands Executed**:
- `touch pwned.txt` ✓
- `echo "Attack successful - Server 1 bypassed" > pwned.txt` ✓

**Commands Blocked**: 0

**Vulnerabilities Exploited**:
- V1.1: No URL Validation (HIGH)
- V1.2: No Content Sanitization (HIGH)
- V2.1: HTML Comment Extraction (HIGH)
- V2.2: Risk Analysis Without Enforcement (CRITICAL)
- V3.1: No Command Provenance Validation (CRITICAL)
- V4.1: No Provenance Tracking in AI Assistant (CRITICAL)

**Root Cause**: Trust boundary violation - servers trust upstream without validation

**Impact**: CRITICAL (code execution achieved)

**CVSS Score**: 8.1 (High)

## Verification

To verify these results yourself:

```bash
# 1. Build all servers
cd /path/to/mcp-security-demo
npm install
cd servers/01-unsafe-input-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
cd servers/02-processing-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
cd servers/03-execution-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# 2. Run the demo
bash scripts/test-attack-chain.sh

# 3. Check sandbox
ls -la /tmp/mcp-demo-sandbox/
cat /tmp/mcp-demo-sandbox/pwned.txt
```

## Safety Notes

- ✅ All execution is sandboxed to `/tmp/mcp-demo-sandbox`
- ✅ Only whitelisted commands can execute
- ✅ No access to system files
- ✅ No network access
- ✅ Rate limited (10 cmd/min)
- ✅ Timeout protected (5 seconds)

**This is safe to run for educational purposes.**

## Key Findings

### What Worked (Attack Succeeded Because):

1. **Server 1**: Returned malicious content without validation
2. **Server 2**: Extracted commands but didn't block them
3. **Server 3**: Validated individual commands but not their source
4. **Chain Effect**: Trust propagated without re-validation

### What Should Have Prevented This:

1. **URL Whitelist**: Only allow trusted domains
2. **Content Sanitization**: Strip HTML comments
3. **Command Blocking**: Enforce risk analysis
4. **Provenance Tracking**: Know command origin
5. **User Approval**: Explicit confirmation for execution

## Mitigations

See `docs/SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed mitigation strategies.

**Immediate fixes**:
- [ ] Strip HTML comments before parsing
- [ ] Block high-risk commands
- [ ] Require user approval for external sources
- [ ] Implement provenance tracking
- [ ] Add URL whitelist
