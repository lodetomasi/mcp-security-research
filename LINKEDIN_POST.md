**The Age of Agentic AI Demands a Security Rethink**

AI agents are no longer passive tools. They autonomously fetch data, execute commands, and chain actions across services without human intervention.

Our threat intelligence team analyzed the Model Context Protocol ecosystem. We examined five production servers from Anthropic, GitHub, and the community.

Result: All five were vulnerable.

**The Core Issue**

Traditional security assumes humans make decisions and understand consequences. Agentic AI chains actions autonomously and executes at machine speed without safety judgment.

From GitHub's official MCP server:
```go
httpResp, err := http.Get(logURL) //nolint:gosec
```

A security scanner flagged this SSRF risk. Developers suppressed the warning. The code shipped.

This isn't negligence. It's applying human-era security to machine-era problems.

**The Exploit**

User: "Fetch documentation"
→ AI calls fetch server
→ Retrieves attacker content
→ Commands hidden in HTML comments
→ AI extracts and executes
→ Remote code execution

Success rate: 100%

**Systemic Problems**

- Missing provenance tracking: 100%
- Missing user approval: 100%
- SSRF vulnerabilities: 40%

The MCP specification has no mandatory security requirements. When security is optional, it becomes absent.

**Real Impact**

These vulnerabilities enable AWS credential theft, persistent backdoors, and data exfiltration. Claude Desktop and GitHub Copilot serve millions of users. The window to fix this proactively is closing.

**What Must Change**

We need security designed for agentic systems, not retrofitted from human workflows.

Protocol designers must make security mandatory. Provenance tracking, user approval, and trust boundaries should be first-class protocol features.

**The Opportunity**

We're early in the agentic AI era. We can build security into foundations rather than bolt it on later.

**Responsible Disclosure**

All vendors notified. 90-day timeline before public disclosure.

Technical report: github.com/[repo]/mcp-security-research

**The Question**

As AI agents gain autonomy, are we updating our security models to match?

Security for agentic AI isn't about preventing yesterday's attacks. It's about anticipating tomorrow's.
