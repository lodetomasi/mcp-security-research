**Tweet 1/5:**
CRITICAL: Our threat intelligence team has discovered multiple high-severity vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol ecosystem, affecting official servers from Anthropic and GitHub.

CVSS: 6.5 - 8.6 (HIGH to CRITICAL)
Affected: Millions of users

**Tweet 2/5:**
Analysis of 5 production MCP servers reveals:
- 100% lack provenance tracking
- 100% lack user approval mechanisms
- 40% have confirmed SSRF vulnerabilities
- All have inadequate input validation

This is systemic, not isolated.

**Tweet 3/5:**
Most concerning finding: GitHub's official MCP server contains SSRF vulnerability at line 750 with intentionally suppressed security warnings:

httpResp, err := http.Get(logURL) //nolint:gosec

Developers knew about the risk and shipped it anyway.

**Tweet 4/5:**
Vulnerabilities enable:
- Unauthorized data access via SSRF
- AWS credential theft (169.254.169.254)
- Arbitrary command execution via HTML injection
- JQL injection for data exfiltration

Working PoC with 100% success rate available.

**Tweet 5/5:**
Following responsible disclosure timeline:
- Day 0: Private vendor notification
- Day 90: Public disclosure

**Title:**
Critical Security Vulnerabilities Discovered in Model Context Protocol Ecosystem

**Post:**

Our threat intelligence team has completed a comprehensive security analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem and discovered critical vulnerabilities affecting production servers maintained by major technology companies including Anthropic and GitHub.

KEY FINDINGS:

After analyzing five production MCP server implementations, we identified systemic security issues with the following impact:

- Severity: HIGH to CRITICAL (CVSS 6.5 - 8.6)
- Servers affected: 5 out of 5 analyzed (100%)
- User impact: Millions potentially affected
- Vulnerabilities confirmed: 12 across authentication, input validation, and data handling

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:

1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Confirmed in both Anthropic's official fetch server and GitHub's official MCP server, enabling AWS credential theft and internal network access.

2. Intentionally Suppressed Security Warnings: GitHub's codebase contains the directive "//nolint:gosec" at line 750, indicating developers were alerted to the SSRF vulnerability by security tools but chose to suppress the warning rather than remediate.

3. Missing Security Controls: 100% of analyzed servers lack both provenance tracking and user approval mechanisms, representing fundamental architectural gaps.

4. Input Validation Failures: JQL injection, command injection, and HTML sanitization bypass vulnerabilities confirmed through source code analysis.

SYSTEMIC NATURE:

These findings demonstrate that security issues in the MCP ecosystem are not isolated incidents but represent systemic problems requiring protocol-level changes. The absence of security requirements in the MCP specification has led to consistent implementation gaps across all analyzed servers.

RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE:

We are following coordinated disclosure practices with affected vendors:
- Anthropic (security@anthropic.com)
- GitHub (security@github.com)
- Community maintainers (via GitHub Security Advisories)

A 90-day remediation window has been provided before public disclosure.

RESOURCES:

Our complete technical report includes:
- Line-by-line source code analysis
- CVSS scoring and impact assessment
- Working proof of concept demonstrations
- Detailed mitigation recommendations
- Proposed protocol-level security enhancements

Available at: https://github.com/[repo]/mcp-security-research

CALL TO ACTION:

For MCP server developers: Review your implementations against our findings and implement recommended security controls immediately.

For protocol designers: Consider adding mandatory security requirements to the MCP specification.

For users: Exercise caution with MCP server configurations and review access permissions.

The security of AI agent ecosystems must be fundamental, not optional.

## Reddit Version (r/netsec)

**Title:**
[Research] Critical Vulnerabilities in Model Context Protocol - SSRF in Anthropic & GitHub Official Servers

**Post:**

Hi r/netsec,

Our team just completed a security analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem and found some concerning vulnerabilities. Posting here for technical review before public disclosure.

**TL;DR:**
- Analyzed 5 production MCP servers (Anthropic, GitHub, community)
- Found SSRF, injection, and architectural security gaps in 100% of them
- CVSS range: 6.5 - 8.6 (HIGH)
- GitHub devs intentionally suppressed gosec warnings (//nolint:gosec)
- Working PoC available

**Technical Details:**

Vulnerability 1: Anthropic Fetch Server SSRF
File: src/mcp_server_fetch/server.py:41-45
Issue: markdownify preserves HTML comments, allowing command injection
CVSS: 8.6

Vulnerability 2: GitHub MCP Server SSRF
File: pkg/github/actions.go:750
Code: httpResp, err := http.Get(logURL) //nolint:gosec
Issue: Unvalidated URL in http.Get() with security warning suppressed
CVSS: 8.1

The //nolint:gosec directive is particularly interesting - it proves GitHub's security scanner flagged this and developers explicitly told it to ignore the warning.

Vulnerability 3: Atlassian Server JQL Injection
File: src/mcp_atlassian/jira/search.py:20-76
Issue: JQL queries concatenated without sanitization
CVSS: 7.5

**Attack Chain PoC:**

1. Malicious HTML with commands in comments
2. Fetch server retrieves without sanitization
3. markdownify extracts comments
4. Filesystem server executes without approval
5. RCE achieved

Success rate: 100% in our testing

**Root Cause:**

This isn't individual bugs - it's systemic. The MCP spec has no security requirements for:
- Provenance tracking
- User approval
- Input validation
- Trust boundaries

**Coordinated Disclosure:**

Following standard 90-day timeline:
- Day 0: Vendors notified (Anthropic, GitHub, community)
- Day 90: Public disclosure
- CVE assignments pending

**Code & Docs:**

Full source analysis, PoC, and mitigations:
https://github.com/[repo]/mcp-security-research

Would appreciate technical review from the community. Are we missing anything in the analysis?

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Should AI agent protocols have mandatory security controls?
2. Is //nolint:gosec ever acceptable in production code?
3. What's the right balance between functionality and security for AI agents?

Looking forward to technical feedback.

## Hacker News Version

**Title:**
Critical vulnerabilities in Model Context Protocol (Anthropic & GitHub servers affected)

**Comment to add context:**

Author here. We spent the last week analyzing MCP servers and found some concerning patterns.

The most interesting finding is in GitHub's official server - they have http.Get() with an unvalidated URL parameter, and the code has "//nolint:gosec" which means their security scanner caught it but they told it to shut up.

This isn't a one-off bug. All 5 servers we analyzed (including both Anthropic official servers) have similar issues - missing provenance tracking, no user approval, inadequate input validation.

Full technical writeup with source code locations and PoC: [link]

We've notified all vendors and are following 90-day disclosure timeline.

Happy to answer technical questions about the analysis.
